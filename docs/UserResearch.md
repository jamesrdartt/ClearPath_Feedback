Obversation 1 (James Dartt):
- Observation Statement: Main complaints from students/employees is that feedback is usually ignored by professors/managers. Because of this, students/employees rarely give feedback, if at all. Main complaints from professors/employers is that feedback is often too vague, so they don't know how to improve, if they can at all. 
- Supporting Data: All of the responese to Question 3b were complaining about how feedback is currently handled. 14/17 responses to Question 5 said users were at least somewhat likely to use an app like ClearPath Feedback.
- Team Action (if any): Make being anonymous an option, since 15/17 responses requested it. Have filtering options.

Observation 4 (Rafael Lacerda):
- Observation Statement: Feedback is usually hard to find, leading to nothing being resulted from said feedback.

- Team Action (if any): Make feedback easy to find and have some way to encourage users to follow through on the feedback.
