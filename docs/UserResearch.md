Obversation 1 (James Dartt):
- Observation Statement: Main complaints from students/employees is that feedback is usually ignored by professors/managers. Because of this, students/employees rarely give feedback, if at all. Main complaints from professors/employers is that feedback is often too vague, so they don't know how to improve, if they can at all. 
- Supporting Data: All of the responese to Question 3b were complaining about how feedback is currently handled. 14/17 responses to Question 5 said users were at least somewhat likely to use an app like ClearPath Feedback.
- Team Action (if any): Make being anonymous an option, since 15/17 responses requested it. Have filtering options.

Observation 4 (Rafael Lacerda):
- Observation Statement: Feedback is usually hard to find, leading to nothing being resulted from said feedback.
- Supporting Data: Questions 3b and 5, show that people want to post and receive feedback but aren't encouraged to do so due to it usually being convoluted to find or not showing any change.
- Team Action (if any): Make feedback easy to find and have some way to encourage users to follow through on the feedback.
